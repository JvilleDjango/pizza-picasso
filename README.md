## User Stories:
### 1. Manage Toppings UI:

As a pizza store owner, I should see a visually appealing dashboard to manage toppings.

I should be able to easily identify each topping through visuals or names.

Adding, updating, or deleting a topping should be intuitive.

Feedback should be clear when I try to enter duplicate toppings.


Consider accessibility when designing the UI.


### 2. Manage Pizzas UI:

As a pizza chef, I need a creation space where I can visualize my pizzas.

The design should help me differentiate between various pizzas and their toppings.

Adding, updating, or deleting a pizza, or its toppings, should be a straightforward process.

Ensure that the UI provides feedback when duplicate pizza names are entered.


Consider designing for different devices: desktop, tablet, and mobile.
